SNARP
=====

SNARP (Simple Noise Activated Recording in Python) is, as the title suggests, a
program to record audio. It is primarily developed on the N900.

Eventually I'll split it up into a recording part and a Graphical frontend. The
frontend would probably be specific to the N900 Maemo 5 QT Widget set.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

To use SNARP from the UNIX command line, specify an output wav file to write to
as a positional argument. By default, snarp.py reads wav data from ``stdin``::

    $ cat test.wav | python snarp.py output.wav

The audio in the output will have frames from silence sections of the input removed,
but otherwise be a frame-for-frame copy of the input. 

Reading data from the standard input makes it particularly easy to read from 
different audio devices using command line audio programs and pipes. Sox_ (cross
platform) and arecord_ (Linux) are suggested. Using Sox' ``rec`` program to 
record system audio input, trimming out silences with SNARP::

    $ rec -t wav - | python snarp.py output.wav

To specify an input file rather than reading from the standard input, use the ``-i``
flag::

    $ python snarp.py -i test.wav output.wav

You may need to override the levels used to define silent periods. These are specified
as decibels below a full scale (i.e. almost clipping) waveform, or dBFS. Since they 
are a fraction of the full scale, they'll always be negative. You can specify both
the peak-to-peak range and the range of the 50th percentile of samples::

    $ # extremely sensitive to noise - picks up whispers
    $ python snarp.py -i test.wav --silence-peak-limit -27 --silence-iqr-limit -36 output.wav
    ...
    $ # much less sensitive, ignores whispers and quiet speech
    $ python snarp.py -i test.wav --silence-peak-limit -15 --silence-iqr-limit -24 output.wav

Other options and usage information can be found with ``python snarp.py -h``.

Original SNARP behavior
-----------------------

Use arecord via pipes to emulate SNARP's original default behavior::

    $ arecord -D hw:0,0 -r 8000 |\
          python snarp.py output.wav

And SNARP's original "podcaster" behavior::

    $ arecord -D front:CARD=Podcaster,DEV=0 -r 48000 -f S24_3LE |\
          python snarp.py output.wav

Limitations
-----------

- There's currently no suport for Python 2.5 and below
- Python's ``wave`` module cannot read wave files with sample widths greater than 16 bits, 
  so neither can we (this is because the Wave format says to use extended headers for wider 
  samples, and the module doesn't read extended headers).
